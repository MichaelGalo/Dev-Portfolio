          <br />
          After a first career in marketing and communications for mission-driven organizations, I realized I was craving deeper technical challenges and the satisfaction of building things from the ground up. That curiosity led me to code — and I haven’t looked back.
          <br />
          <br />
          I love engineering solutions that blend logic and creativity. Whether it’s designing data pipelines, architecting databases, or building full web apps, I enjoy solving problems that require both structure and imagination.
          <br />
          <br />
          With a growing toolkit across many programming languages, cloud services, and modern web frameworks, I'm excited by work that makes data accessible, automates the boring stuff, and delivers meaningful impact. In short, I’m all about building systems that help others do what they do best.
