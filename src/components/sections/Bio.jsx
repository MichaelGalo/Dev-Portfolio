          Transitioning from a first career in marketing & communications
          primarily for non-profits & B-Corp brands, I hadn't quite found the
          analytical challenge I was craving in my career. Combine this with a
          lego-filled childhood and the university path never walked named{" "}
          <strong>computer science</strong>, I decided to take Dolly's advice
          and pave my own path into: <strong>software development</strong>.
          <br />
          <br />
          After learning to solve some real-life headaches with code, I
          discovered an intoxicating recipe of logic, creativity, humbling
          debugging and deep fulfillment in the projects I was working on. After
          that, I knew I wasn't going back. This is the most fun I've had with
          my work in years and my brain was beings stretched more than ever. I
          can't wait to see how many more surprises software development has in
          store for me and how I can continue to turn novel ideas into apps that
          make an impact, solve problems, and make people smile.
