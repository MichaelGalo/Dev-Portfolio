# Dev-Portfolio

This repository is a curated developer portfolio for myself, Michael Galo. It is a showcase site that highlights my work spanning from Data Engineering and Web Development. The site is intended as a presentation of projects, technical approaches and proficiency across multiple software engineering disciplines.
